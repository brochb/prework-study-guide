# Prework Study-Guide Webpage

## Description

- A Study Guide Developed to Fascilitate Both Study, and Organization of Notes Taken for Bootcamp Students
- Among other reasons, the driving force for the creation of the webpage is because of the density of notes, and sometimes random application of said notes in different portions of the learning.
- The project was created to help students maintain an organized space where all notes can be catalogued, and accessed easily.
- Oftentimes it is difficult to streamline, and balance study structure. This guide solves that by offering a random topic to study when the webpage is accessed.
- The project has taught each contributor the importance of syntax, and control flow. It has also taught us the importance of a README file, and it's place in the project as the "Front Page", offering insight, and guidance on what the project is, why it exists, and how to install/operate the project.
- This project offers access to notes, and resources on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, and well as command reminders, and shortcuts for each.
